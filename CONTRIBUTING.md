# Contributing to Awesome Rust Python

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This document provides guidelines for contributing to this awesome list.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the repository** and create a new branch for your contribution
2. **Add your project** to the appropriate category in README.md
3. **Submit a pull request** with a clear description of what you're adding

## Inclusion Criteria

To be included in this list, a project must meet the following criteria:

### Required

- **Open Source**: Must have an OSI-approved open source license
- **Rust Core**: Must use Rust for core functionality (not just bindings to existing C libraries)
- **Python Interface**: Must provide a Python API or be usable from Python
- **Functional**: Must be in a usable state (not just a proof of concept)

### Preferred

- **Active Maintenance**: Actively maintained projects are preferred, though historically significant projects may be included
- **Documentation**: Should have basic documentation explaining how to use it
- **Published**: Ideally published on PyPI or similar package registry
- **Quality**: Should demonstrate clear benefits (performance, safety, etc.) over pure Python alternatives

## Formatting Guidelines

### Entry Format

Each entry should follow this format:

```markdown
- **[Project Name](https://github.com/username/project)** - Brief description of what the project does and its key features.
```

### Guidelines

- **Alphabetical Order**: Projects within each category should be in alphabetical order
- **Description**: Keep descriptions concise (1-2 sentences) and focus on what makes the project useful
- **Links**: Use the main GitHub repository URL (or official project page if not on GitHub)
- **Capitalization**: Use proper capitalization for project names as specified by the project maintainers

## Categories

Projects should be placed in the most appropriate category:

- **Build Tools & Frameworks**: Tools for building Rust-Python extensions
- **Data Processing**: Data manipulation, serialization, and processing libraries
- **Development Tools**: Linters, formatters, package managers, and other dev tools
- **Web & Networking**: Web servers, HTTP clients, networking libraries, and security tools
- **Machine Learning & AI**: ML frameworks, NLP tools, and AI-related libraries

If a project doesn't fit existing categories, suggest a new category in your pull request.

## Adding Resources

When adding learning resources, articles, or blog posts:

- Ensure the content is high-quality and relevant
- Prefer official documentation and well-established sources
- Include the author or source when relevant
- Keep descriptions brief but informative

## Pull Request Process

1. **Check for duplicates**: Search existing entries to avoid duplicates
2. **One project per PR**: Submit separate PRs for multiple projects (unless they're closely related)
3. **Clear description**: Explain why the project should be included
4. **Follow formatting**: Ensure your entry follows the formatting guidelines
5. **Test links**: Verify all links work before submitting

## Quality Standards

We aim to maintain a high-quality list. Pull requests may be rejected if:

- The project doesn't meet inclusion criteria
- The description is unclear or misleading
- The project is abandoned or non-functional
- The project is a duplicate of an existing entry
- The formatting doesn't follow guidelines

## Questions?

If you're unsure whether a project fits or have questions about contributing, feel free to open an issue for discussion before submitting a pull request.

## Code of Conduct

Be respectful and constructive in all interactions. We're here to build a useful resource for the community.
